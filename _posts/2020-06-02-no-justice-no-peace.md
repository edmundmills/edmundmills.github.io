Last night I wrote these words to myself:

## **Let yourself be transformed by this moment.**

Let yourself be transformed by your sorrow and rage.

Let yourself step into the disintegration of whatever shreds of a predictable future still remained.

Let your helplessness and despair be healed by acting with others and so remember our collective power.

Let your preoccupation with your personal story lose itâ€™s weight for a new story of solidarity and courage.

Let whatever fury is in you become a vow of dedication to justice.
