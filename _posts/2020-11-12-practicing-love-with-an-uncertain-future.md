Dark clouds gather in the future and fog obscures our path. The days when the future seemed sunny and idyllic have passed. Occasionally, rays of sunlight shine through—promising news of a COVID vaccine, for example, or our recent election results. Have we, as we compulsively doom-scroll our excruciating national story, become so addicted to doom that good news hardly registers? Or is there simply so much darkness that these glimmers of light offer little hope?

Whether we see doom or the clearing of skies, we are obsessed with the future. And, not without good reason—layers of heavy conditions weigh on us. We’re waiting for them to be lifted, for things to return to normal. Four years ago or so, the toxicity and absurdity of our politics intensified. The anxiety-activating news cycle has seeped ever further into our lives. And, in March of this year, when we entered lockdown, we put on hold so many of the things that bring us meaning, direction, and joy. As our COVID-inflected present has stretched on, it’s been easy to defer life to the future, when we imagine things will return to normal.

Meanwhile, to the detriment of our collective wellbeing, much of our country has refused to likewise defer their lives. There’s something about this refusal to stop living that could be beautiful, if only it was paired with an active love of following public health guidelines. Somewhere in there is a commitment to appreciating and living life, in spite of suffering and uncertainty. These two sides, present-oriented aliveness and future-oriented altruism, roughly trace one of the perennial dialectics of the heart.

## A dialectic of the heart

This dialectic is central to the endeavor of living well in an era of climate change. From one end we are squeezed by the destabilization the future holds, and from the other by our complicity in great suffering. Refuge in a secure future is no longer possible; refuge in the present is complicated by unfulfilled ethical responsibility. Neither climate action nor ignoring the future is satisfactory—what is called for is a richer and more nuanced inner conversation between surrender and peace on one side, and responsibility and love on the other.

## Climate change invites us to surrender the search for a secure future

Climate change invites deep and radical responses. One of these is releasing our tendency to seek ultimate meaning, security, or resolution in the future. Our worldview, conditioned by fossil fuels, includes entitlement to progress and control over the future. These expectations are maladaptive in our changing world. Leaving the palace of fossil fuel based ways of life involves leaving them behind.\[1\]

### Absorption in the drive to become diminishes us

The particular form of future-orientedness encapsulated in our expectations for progress and control Buddhism calls becoming: the security-driven process of envisioning a future state of being or identity, seizing it, and setting things in motion to become it. This natural process is vital to our engagement with life. It's a way we express love and creativity. But it’s also something that we can get too absorbed in. When we do, we lose contact with all our other ways of finding meaning.

Jim Corbett articulates this well, tracing our relationship to time to our mode of subsistence. He contrasts becoming, which he calls man-in-time, with a more present-oriented way of being, man-in-nature:\[2\]

> Pastoral nomadism is similar to most hunter-gatherer cultures in its concentration on the present, in its reliance on and adaptation to the given aspects of nature, and in its emphasis on unrelenting observation and awareness. Peasant and commercial economies, on the other hand, place their emphasis on the work needed to transform and develop unimproved conditions and raw materials into wealth. For the nomadic hunter-gatherer or pastoralist, wealth is created by sun, rain, and soil. To think of one’s life as time to be invested or to sacrifice the present to an uncertain future is foolishness for man-in-nature; it is as obvious that life is a gift rather than a reward as it is obvious to man-in-time, who labors for future fulfillment in an ever-dying present, that life can be supported only by work, investment, the accumulation of wealth—above all, that the past is dead and the present moment in which one's life is trapped is just the point where the future dies. Man-in-time labors in an empty present that is death; he grasps for a future that must die when he touches it.

It has always been true that finding ultimate meaning in the future is a lost cause. Climate change drives this point home—there is nowhere safe and the future can’t be controlled.

### Finding meaning here and now

We have so much momentum driving us to orient around the future. Our biology, psychology, culture, economic conditions, and news media all push us in this direction. But we can change course and come home to the present moment, little by little. It’s here that we can find meaning independent of an unreliable future. And as the future's uncertainty grows, it’s here we can find points of intervention.

As we return to the present we may discover anxiety fueling our drive to become, whether climate anxiety or otherwise. We can feel this in the body, care for it, hold it, breathe with it, let it settle. We can offer it warmth and space, and, in seeing it, become free of it’s power.\[3\]

When we relax our obsession with the future, we become available to what’s here and now, even if only temporarily. Then space is available for appreciating the traces of meaning in the present, and joys, large and small. Can these be enough?

#### Discovering world as gift

When we’re really here, not fixated on making something happen, not focused on creating some kind of meaningfulness or security in the future, we can see life as a gift. Robin Wall Kimmerer writes of experiencing the world as gift:\[4\]

> In the old times, when people’s lives were so directly tied to the land it was easy to know the world as gift. When fall came, the skies would darken with flocks of geese, honking “Here we are.” It reminds the people of the Creation story, when the geese came to save Skywoman. The people are hungry, winter is coming, and the geese fill the marshes with food. It is a gift and the people receive it with thanksgiving, love, and respect.
> 
> But when the food does not come from a flock in the sky, when you don’t feel the warm feathers cool in your hand and know that a life has been given for yours, when there is no gratitude in return—that food may not satisfy. It may leave the spirit hungry while the belly is full. Something is broken when the food comes on a Styrofoam tray wrapped in slippery plastic, a carcass of a being whose only chance at life was a cramped cage. That is not a gift of life; it is a theft.
> 
> How, in our modern world, can we find our way to understand the earth as a gift again, to make our relations with the world sacred again? I know we cannot all become hunter-gatherers—the living world could not bear our weight—but even in a market economy, can we behave “as if” the living world were a gift?
> 
> Robin Wall Kimmerer, _Braiding Sweetgrass_

Returning to the present, beginning with finding gratitude in small moments, is a beginning. When we step out of our future-based ambitions, the smallness of our lives can be seen in proper perspective. This lets us remember our belonging to a larger world. This belonging is not something we need to earn or prove, but intrinsic to our being.

#### Receiving the gift of the earth calls for reciprocity

And with this remembering, we can remember more— that the gift of belonging asks for reciprocation. We have a responsibility to the elements of our world—to the sky, the earth, and the other beings we share it with, human and non-human.

## The resolve to care

As we loosen our grip on becoming and search for more resilient sources of meaning, it’s time to bring back the other side of this dialectic, compassion. Otherwise, we risk becoming estranged from the realities of the world and our responsibilities. So the second part of this contemplation is remembering the intensity of the suffering in the world, our complicity in it, and our ethical responsibility to care for it. These two sides, releasing the future and active love, or gratitude and reciprocity, form a dialectic in our hearts, an ongoing conversation that works on us as we work on it.

With hearts opened and nourished by gratitude, we can remember that the systems that support our comfort also create injustice and suffering throughout the world. We can drink this reality into the depths of our hearts, not letting impulses for urgent action divert it, but letting it’s dark waters pool in our depths, fermenting into resolve and seeping into the bedrock of our being as a refusal to participate in these systems. Its burning acidity can keep our eyes open and senses sharp for opportunities to intervene, to dismantle, to step aside, to yield, or to contribute to an alternative.

It's true that we can keep our eyes open here and now, and it's true that caring for the world requires thinking, planning, and considering the future. This conversation doesn’t end; the dialectic remains for us to carry in our hearts.

## Shaping change, yielding to change

Ultimately, we can’t resolve the dialectic between surrender and action, we can only express it through living. When we, perhaps temporarily, abandon making demands of the future, our preconceptions for how it should unfold, our entitlement to control and progress, we can find an openness to the present, to touch and be changed by it, to be in relationship with life. I love the way Octavia Butler's character Lauren Olamina expresses this:\[5\]

> All that you touch,
> 
> You Change.
> 
> All that you change
> 
> Changes you.
> 
> The only lasting truth
> 
> is Change.
> 
> God is Change.

Rather than being oriented toward fulfilling becoming, we can find ultimate meaning in being open to change, in learning from it, in being in communication with the changing unfolding of reality.

She continues (remember, God is Change):

> We do not worship God.
> 
> We perceive and attend God.
> 
> We learn from God.
> 
> With forethought and work,
> 
> We shape God.
> 
> In the end, we yield to God.

This is another expression of the dialectic I’ve been discussing—between actively loving the world and surrendering, between gratitude and reciprocity, between shaping the future and yielding to it. And it points to how, along the way, we can find meaning in the process rather than the outcome.
