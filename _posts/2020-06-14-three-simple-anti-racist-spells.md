I hope whatever resolve you have to work for racial justice is still alive and well in you. We may be near the time when the flash of inspiration fades and we transition to steady, patient work. Like me, you may be all too familiar with the cycle of waxing and waning inspiration, played out in ways large and small, across areas of life. How do you fold these cycles into steady resolve and patient effort? One way is to establish conditions that carry us forward, independent of our effort or inspiration. I like to think of as magic: the channeling of the energy of inspiration into transmuting the blueprint that shapes our life’s unfolding. In other words, working through changing underlying conditions rather than discrete and direct actions.

### Reworking your media stream

The media we take in color our thoughts and shape our worldview. For many of us, this stream comes about haphazardly, an accumulation of small decisions, all influenced by inner and outer conditions. If we haven’t looked at the media we take in through the lens of race (& gender), we might be surprised by how much of it is produced by white men. To take some time to diversify your stream can yield months to years of listening to the perspectives of people of different backgrounds, particularly black & indigenous people of color (BIPOC).

**In Practice**:

1. Inventory your media stream. What are the channels it flows through? (e.g. books, news, FB, twitter, youtube, etc.) What are the topics you regularly attend to?
2. Who’s voices are present? Who’s are absent?
3. Devote some time seeking out BIPOC voices in each of your main areas of interest and bringing them into each of the channels in your media stream. The key is to embed these new sources pervasively throughout and deep within the stream, rather than as a one-of, add-on, or distinct topic.

### Bending the flow of green energy

Money flows in patterns. Like our media stream, these patterns are often unconsciously accumulated, but can be shaped to reflect our deeper values. New habits set in place can over time wear away the centuries-built racial wealth gap.

**In Practice (A):** Redirect donations to organizations that are committed to racial justice.

1. Read this short article on [Social Justice Philanthropy](https://resourcegeneration.org/what-we-do/social-justice-philanthropy-and-giving/).
2. Research the organizations you currently support. Are they committed and working toward racial justice? Are there similar organizations that meet more of the criteria in the above article, like being led by people in the communities they serve?
3. Make a monthly donation in support of racial justice, to one of the [organizations listed here](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/6/9/21281538/how-to-donate-to-black-lives-matter-charity).
4. Notice how this feels—remembering and appreciating our ethical integrity or generosity supports it’s growth.

**In Practice (B)**: Support local black-owned local businesses.

Black-owned businesses have been hit [particularly hard](https://www.theroot.com/coronavirus-expected-to-wipe-out-40-percent-of-black-ow-1843999079) by the coronavirus, and as we begin to open up and go out more, it’s the perfect time to put in place habits of supporting them. Find a list of local black-owned businesses online. Consider which could be incorporated into your routines of shopping, eating out, etc. What could reasonably become an enduring habit, rather than a one-time event?

### Tapping into social permeability

The people we spend time with co-create us. They influence the attitudes and actions we consider normal and acceptable. By joining a group of people dedicated to anti-racist action, we can be carried forward if we just keep showing up.

**In Practice:**

Find a local white caucus like [SURJ](https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/). You may also be able to find one through your local faith community, or another organization or community you’re a part of. Try to find one where you might make friends and establish long term bonds.

With these three relatively simple spells, with just a few hours of craft, reach into the underlying patterns that give rise to your life, divert the stream to carry your resolution for justice to fulfillment.
